# Project for ECE470 FA2019 - Navigate Obstacle course
## Team Member : 
* Albert Chan (albertc2)
* Yihui Cui (ycui11)

## One of our team member dropped out of the class

## About Project :
In this project, we are going to build a robot in V-REP simulator. 
Here's the desired capabilities of our robot :
* Navigate toward a target point
* Avoid obstacles along the way
* Use Opencv to plan path when obstacle is encountered
* Proximity sensor 

## Project Most Recent Update :
### 09-21 project update 2
* react to voice signal is mostly infeasible since there's no sensor that detect voice signal in V-REP that would be used as feedback to our robot 
* meet up and tested V-REP 
* figure out what is the available sensors we could use in order to achieve our objectives 
### 10-12 project update 3
* Change objective of project
* Implemented Obstacle Avoidance Code
* Differential Drive Kinematics
* Read Vision Sensor Data and install opencv

## Project Timeline:
* Move toward desired position
* Blob detection of obstacles on path
* Path planning around detected obstacles
